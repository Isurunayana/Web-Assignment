		<h1>Promoting Quality Education</h1>
		<p>Right to Education widely ensures children a right to free and compulsory education but what it fails to account for is “Quality Education” that requires creation of infrastructure and environment conducive to a learning environment.</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			Shramik Bharti’s education interventions are aimed towards holistic development through innovation in learning process, enhancement of infrastructure and capacity-building of stakeholders. We worked in Uttar Pradesh in the districts of Barabanki, Fatehpur, Chandauli & Bhadohi; and in Punjab in the districts of Firozpur, Amritsar and Taran Taran, to improve teaching learning atmosphere in government schools. Our interventions are based on needs-assessment insights and projects are designed to adopt innovative learning tools and techniques and adapt to the current challenges in Indian education system.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			We aim our efforts to promote education in a multi-pronged way by inculcating the habit of reading and curiosity, and promote sports to incorporate physical and social skills amongst the children by engaging children. To engage the students, art workshops are organized to inculcate aesthetics and abstract thinking amongst the children. Developing kitchen gardens within the school premises for growing safe & fresh vegetables for children allows better nutrition to be incorporated in the mid-day meals.
