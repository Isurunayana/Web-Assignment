		<h1>Promoting Quality Education</h1>
		<p>Right to Education widely ensures children a right to free and compulsory education but what it fails to account for is “Quality Education” that requires creation of infrastructure and environment conducive to a learning environment.</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			Shramik Bharti’s education interventions are aimed towards holistic development through innovation in learning process, enhancement of infrastructure and capacity-building of stakeholders. We worked in Uttar Pradesh in the districts of Barabanki, Fatehpur, Chandauli & Bhadohi; and in Punjab in the districts of Firozpur, Amritsar and Taran Taran, to improve teaching learning atmosphere in government schools. Our interventions are based on needs-assessment insights and projects are designed to adopt innovative learning tools and techniques and adapt to the current challenges in Indian education system.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>
			We aim our efforts to promote education in a multi-pronged way by inculcating the habit of reading and curiosity, and promote sports to incorporate physical and social skills amongst the children by engaging children. To engage the students, art workshops are organized to inculcate aesthetics and abstract thinking amongst the children. Developing kitchen gardens within the school premises for growing safe & fresh vegetables for children allows better nutrition to be incorporated in the mid-day meals.

	<h1>Our Facilities</h1>
	<p>Universities are struggling to create facilities in a technology-friendly environment across the campuses in multiple locations.

Some institutions have sprawling playing fields, swimming pools and indoor stadiums that you can use at your leisure or as a member of a sporting club. Many have also have on-campus gyms for a handy workout between classes.</p>

						I like that all the information students receive is up-to-date and we are learning principles and theories of Advertising and Marketing using the latest examples from the industry. The course is very interesting and engaging, and I can already feel how my communication skills and critical thinking skills are improving after my first semester.
						<br>

I'm in love with the library facilities to be honest. Mac computers, rooms for group work and even the rest zone with fake grass and comfy pillows make the learning process flow much better.

						The course I study included an industrial placement and after speaking to the careers team at the open day I attended it seemed perfect. For my industrial placement I worked as a ‘Partner Marketing Executive’ at Microsoft’s UK headquarters in Reading, where I was able to apply my studies to a business environment, get exposure in a fantastic company and meet some fantastic people.
