  <h3>The SDGs or Sustainable Development Goals were set in 2015 by the United Nations General Assembly and are intended to be achieved by the year 2030. These are a collection of 17 Global Goals designed to be a "blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all.” The SDGs were developed to succeed the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) which ended in 2015.</h3>

<br>
 Major progress has been made towards increasing access to education at all levels and increasing enrolment rates in schools particularly for women and girls.</h3>
 <br>
<h2 style= "border:1px dashed blue;">How does quality education impact the world?</h2>
<h3>A quality education is the number one factor that empowers people to rise out of poverty, as they become equipped with valuable skills necessary for gaining employment.
<br>
 According to the UNESCO Global Education Monitoring Report, each additional year of schooling increases a person's earnings by roughly 10%.</h3>
